Hi! I'm Cappy! 

I'm a DevOps engineer (and occasionally Software engineer) and I act as the CIO of [Fyra Labs]!

I specialize in building and maintaining lightweight, secure, and scalable infrastructure.

I also love writing software that makes people's lives easier (usually not as web apps though).


## FAQ

### Why did you not make this website using [Insert Framework, language, or tool here]? And why do you use some lazy template off GitHub instead?

TL;DR: I'm lazy.

#### Long answer

I am ***not*** a web developer.

While I do know how to make websites, I don't enjoy making them. My main focus is on building infrastructure and writing systems software, not making websites.

I don't like spending time on making websites when I could be building Ultramarine Linux, or brainstorming and making a nifty cool DevOps tool that makes everyone's life easier, Watching anime, or just playing Half-Life.

My main focus is building systems software, Linux distributions, Developer tools, and just QoL system utilities.

I have like 5 projects I usually work on at any given time, and I don't want to spend time making a website when I could be working on those projects.

So, ***fuck off***, and stop nagging me.

### What's your favorite programming language?

Rust.

### What's your favorite text editor?

[Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/).

But I usually use VSCode because it's more convenient.
